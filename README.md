## Peer review :Xavier - Everything Works as intend too, I kine the person you choose for but one thing that ws off was the purple color background but another thing is maybe fix the images at the home page to  change their size because  you have a scroll sideway for a image which this not a big issue but just kind of saying, but may on accomplishment page maybe make the image items-center because it look of and is not matching the container with your text inside of it, I also say the gap between image is fun fact is a little to much maybe you can tight it a little bit so it not to far apart from the container or you can move the container over a little bit but beside these issues it looks good to me.
